# Dictionaries

A dictionary is an unordered data structure that maps a key value to an object. By storing objects as key-value pairs instead of as a ordered-sequence, objects can be retrieved from a dictionary in constant time.

## Dictionary lookup Complexity

| Operation      | Worst-case | Best-case |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Get item by    | θ(n)       | θ(1)      |
| Set item by    | θ(n)       | θ(1)      |
| Delete item by | θ(n)       | θ(1)      |
| Iteration      | θ(n)       | θ(n)      |
