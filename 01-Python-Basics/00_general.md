# Comments

Single line comments in Python are denoted with `#` (hashtag symbol). All the characters after the `#` in `.py` document will be ignored any characters following the `#` on the same line.

Comments can be placed on their own line, or after code.

```py
# I am a comment
"Hello" # I am also a comment
```
