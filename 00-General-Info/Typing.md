# Python Typing

Python is a **dynamically typed** language, which means that you can re-assign variables to different data types.

> Dynamically typed languages allow variables to be re-assigned to different types

> Statically typed languages require that variable re-assignments be of the **same** data-type

## Example

```py
# integer
my_dogs = 2

# array
my_dogs = ["Sammy", "Frank"]

```

## Benefits of Dynamic Typing

- Easier to read → no type annotations to distract from code logic
- Faster development → no need to declare variable types

## Drawbacks of Dynamic Typing

- May results in bugs from unexpected data types

## Checking types

You can use the `type()` function to check the type of any variable or constant in Python
